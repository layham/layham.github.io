                                        <p>The Playing Field is in Upper Layham, immediately adjacent to Brett Green. It
                                            can be accessed from Mill Lane and from Brett Green. It is run by a
                                            Management Committee – Chairman: Michael Woods, tel. 01473 823

                                            an area hedged off from the play area which is being developed as a
                                            conservation area. It is accessible to walkers but children are dissuaded
                                            from playing there.<br/><br/></p>
                                        <h2>The story of Layham Playing Field</h2>
                                        <p>Twenty seven years ago our Playing Field was a pasture. It was part of the
                                            land associated with Layham Mill and there was no public access.<br/><br/>In
                                            1981 representation had been made to the Parish Council to seek a play area
                                            as all the agricultural land was fenced off and the only open space for
                                            children to play on was roadways or the greens in Brett Green. Under the
                                            chairmanship of Tom Partridge the Council made enquiries and obtained the
                                            agreement of the then owners of the land (Mr and Mrs Duffield) that when
                                            they sold Mill House and the land around, they would give first option to
                                            the village to purchase the pasture. It was a happy coincidence that they
                                            were about to move away.<br/><br/>An interest free loan for £12,000 was
                                            obtained from the National Playing Fields Association and the pasture was
                                            bought in September 1982. The loan was paid back over 10 years by a local
                                            charge being made on the Council Tax – thus the field was truly bought by
                                            the people. It was a courageous decision by the Parish Council and we are
                                            for ever in their debt.<br/><br/>The field was put in Trust and a committee
                                            formed to manage it. Over the following 27 years, bit by bit, what you see
                                            now has been built up. Local people paid for the trees that made up the
                                            willow plantation (a source of income ever since) and a grant was obtained
                                            to buy the first piece of play equipment. Fund raising was varied – a
                                            sponsored footpath walk, barn dances, firework evenings, fetes, a Burns
                                            Night in the Village Hall – many and varied activities. The 100 Club was
                                            launched and has been supported by local people ever since.<br/><br/>Gates
                                            were put in, more apparatus purchased, a garage store built and more trees
                                            planted – many members of the community have donated trees for different
                                            reasons. In recent years, goalposts and a picnic table have been provided
                                            and most recently a living willow shelter built.<br/><br/>At the far end of
                                            the field a Conservation Area has slowly taken shape – the small posters on
                                            the field describe what has been done there.<br/><br/>What shouldn’t be
                                            forgotten is that all through the 27 years a small group of people have
                                            worked to maintain and develop the field – cutting grass, thickening hedges,
                                            planting the trees, developing the conservation area – in fact almost
                                            everything has been done by local voluntary labour. We pay to have the main
                                            field cut as that is just too much for a small committee.<br/><br/>We know
                                            how much you all value the field – whether a child who loves to play, dog
                                            owner, nature lover, sports enthusiast, fisherman or just someone who likes
                                            to walk in an open space. Please find ways to help your village maintain
                                            this very important place.<br/><br/></p>

                                        <h2>The history of the Village Hall in its own words</h2>
                                        <p>“I became a feature in Layham on the 20th November 1928. At that time I was
                                            known as ‘The Hut’, a name that stuck with me until 1967.<br/><br/>The Men’s
                                            Club to whom I belonged not only used me as their clubroom, but also allowed
                                            functions for the village, for which they obviously obtained rent to help
                                            with my running costs. There were dances, whist drives and a ’Mixed Club’.
                                            They even held ‘Smoking Parties’ - something that would not be allowed
                                            today! All these functions were arranged and discussed at monthly meetings. 
                                            Every year Christmas was celebrated with a children’s party organised by the
                                            Men’s Club.<br/><br/>The Men’s Club purchased a billiards table just before
                                            I was built and with darts, table tennis and carpet bowls, I was regularly
                                            used.<br/><br/>After the war years the membership flagged slightly and the
                                            age limit was reduced to 15yrs. in an effort to rejuvenate
                                            activities.<br/><br/>Membership fees, which used to be 2d per week, were the
                                            maximum allowed by the Government of the time, before the addition of tax.
                                            In 1957 they eventually decided that they would have to increase this sum to
                                            4d a week.<br/><br/>In 1960 they installed a ‘Bering’ stove, which was
                                            positioned against the side wall, as the old oyster stove in the centre was
                                            inconvenient when dances were held.<br/><br/>A change occurred on 30th March
                                            1967, when the keys and responsibility for my care was transferred to a
                                            ‘Village Hall Committee’.  This Committee was given a kick start with
                                            £366.19.6d from the village fund.<br/><br/>Things ran smoothly for a few
                                            years until my committee had an administrative breakdown with only £2.88
                                            left in the kitty! A new committee was formed with the help of the Parish
                                            Council.<br/><br/>In 1974 I was fixed up with running water.<br/><br/>The
                                            next event I remember was the application to give me charity status. This
                                            was granted on 23rd July 1986.<br/><br/>October 1987 was a disaster, for as
                                            I was resting peacefully one night, a terrible gale forced me to lean over
                                            towards the field next door and I was retired for about six months."</p>
                                        <h2>More facts about the Village Hall</h2>
                                        <p>The Village Hall was originally built for the ex-service men of Layham after
                                            World War I. The plans to build the hut were proposed and accepted in
                                            January 1928 and the tender was given to a Mr. A. Dunningham at a sum of two
                                            hundred and fifty three pounds four shillings (£253.20 in today’s
                                            money).</p>
                                        <p>The Hut (the name by which it was affectionally known at that time) was
                                            finally completed in November 1928 and was opened officially on the 20th
                                            November by Mrs Tenison. On the 21st November the first whist drive and
                                            dance was held.<br/><br/>A little snippet of interest is that the Men’s Club
                                            bought one hundred stick-back chairs at a price of  twenty-one pounds five
                                            shillings, (£21.25).  In today’s money this works out at approximately 21
                                            pence each! (In the Autumn of 1996 the Village Hall Committee sold 30 of
                                            these chairs, all of which were damaged, for £17 each!)<br/><br/>The keys of
                                            The Hut were officially handed to the Parish in March 1967 and it
                                            subsequently became known as The Village Hall.<br/><br/>The hall is managed
                                            by the Village Hall Committee, whose core members are Richard Cranfield
                                            (Chairman),
                                            Jan McNelly (Secretary), Judith Hermite (Treasurer) and Rosemary Nicholls
                                            (Bookings).  They are responsible to a trust, for the care and
                                            maintenance of the building.<br/><br/>The Committee is responsible to the
                                            Trustees, who are Mr. John English, David English and Nigel
                                            Thorpe.<br/><br/>The major users are Layham Playgroup and the Ladybird Group
                                            (toddlers) during the mornings and the Men’s Club which meets on Tuesday
                                            evenings. The Parish Council and St. Andrew’s Church are regular customers
                                            and the hall is available for private parties &amp; functions etc.
                                            throughout the year.<br/><br/>We are indeed fortunate to have what is now
                                            becoming a unique building. Those of you who use the hall will know that it
                                            has a very ‘personal’ feel about it and over the years the Committee has
                                            done its best to bring the hall into the 21st century in a sympathetic way
                                            retaining as much of the original charm as possible.</p>
