<p><strong>Communication is everything in today’s world!</strong><br /><br />We all know how difficult it is to ensure that information gets to every home in Layham - sometimes it’s a simple matter of timing when we need a response at short notice.  Sometimes it’s down to the cost of producing flyers etc - and sometimes it’s just straightforward lack of manpower!<br /><br />So, in effort to make life easier for everyone, the Parish Council has set up a <strong>Layham community email</strong> system.  We want to collect email addresses from as many households as possible so that we can build a mailing list and disseminate information with just one click.  The mailing list is stored on the Parish Council computer system and is only accessed by Jane Cryer, Layham’s Parish Clerk. <br /><br />If you think this is a good idea, and you would like to be receive information in this way, send an e-mail to

 </script>, including your name and address.<br /><br />Communication will be carefully controlled and used only for information the Parish Council thinks will be useful to you.  Messages will always be sent by BLIND COPY, so your email address will not be visible to anyone else. You will be able to unsubscribe at any time if you change your mind by simply sending an email to the same address, from the email account you used originally, with the subject line "unsubscribe".<br /><br />Examples of messages sent from the Parish Clerk over the past year that may have been informative or useful to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>details of the Remembrance Day ceremony at the village war memorial</li>
<li>Emergency Planning - storm warnings etc</li>
<li>examples of road closures / diversions</li>
<li>dates for your diaries - eg village clean-up, community lunches</li>
<li>warnings about possible 'scams'</li>
<li>notification of the Annual Parish Meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, with the consent of participants, it should be possible to extend the system to include advertising for village events run by, for example, the PCC, the Playing Field and the Village Hall.</p></td>
